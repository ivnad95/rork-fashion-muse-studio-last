# Work Log

## Current Status
- Ported shared Deep Sea Glass palette aliases into `constants/glassStyles.ts` so components can reuse ManusAI tokens (background gradient, silver text spectrum, accent blues).
- Rebuilt shared primitives to match the reference app: `GlassyTitle`, `ImageUploader`, `CountSelector`, and the floating `CustomTabBar` now render frosted glass surfaces identical to Fashion Muse Studio ManusAI.
- Restyled `(tabs)/generate.tsx` and `(tabs)/results.tsx` with the new primitives and layout structure from the reference screens (credit capsule, variation chips, results grid, glass progress banner, modal actions).
- Settings and History screens only have header updates so far; their body layouts still use older neumorphic panels and need to be swapped for the new glass components.

## Next Steps
1. Finish migrating `(tabs)/history.tsx` to the new aesthetic: replace `NeumorphicPanel` sections with `GlassPanel`, simplify the grouped list layout, and restyle the modal overlay per ManusAI.
2. Do the same for `(tabs)/settings.tsx`, ensuring all sections (account card, API key panel, preferences) use the new glass primitives and gradients.
3. After UI parity is complete, revisit existing lint warnings (unused imports, hook dependencies, CommonJS `require` calls) to keep the repo clean.
4. Optional after UI work: re-theme auth/onboarding routes and any modals (`plans.tsx`) so every surface matches the Deep Sea Glass spec.
