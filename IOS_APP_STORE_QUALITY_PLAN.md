```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  import('@/scripts/add-credits');
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable (conditional import)
**Priority:** P2 - Medium
**Recommendation:** Verify this is tree-shaken in production builds

#### Network Error Handling
- **Status:** ✅ Good (GenerationContext.tsx has comprehensive error handling)
- **Priority:** P2 - Medium
- **Current Implementation:**
  - Timeout handling (180s)
  - Retry logic (2 attempts)
  - Rate limiting detection
  - Image size validation (4MB max)
  - Network error recovery

**Recommendations:**

1. Add accessibility labels to all interactive elements
2. Support VoiceOver for blind users
3. Ensure color contrast ratios meet standards
4. Support Dynamic Type
5. Add haptic feedback (already present ✅)
6. Test with Accessibility Inspector

**Example Improvements Needed:**
```typescript
// app/(tabs)/generate.tsx - Add accessibility
<TouchableOpacity
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Upload photo button"
  accessibilityHint="Select a photo from your library to transform"
  accessibilityRole="button"
>
```

### 5.2 Localization

**Current Status:** English only
**Priority:** P3 - Low (can be added post-launch)

**Recommendation:**
- Start with English (US)
- Plan for future localization:

---

## 6. DATA & SECURITY

### 6.1 Data Storage

**Current Implementation:**
- SQLite local database ✅
- AsyncStorage for session ✅
- Local password hashing (SHA-256 + salt) ⚠️

**Security Assessment:**
- **Good:** Local-only data storage
- **Good:** SQLCipher enabled for iOS
- **Concern:** SHA-256 not ideal for passwords (consider bcrypt/scrypt)
- **Good:** No cloud sync (simpler privacy compliance)

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider stronger password hashing (bcrypt/scrypt)
2. Add data export functionality
3. Add "Delete Account & Data" option
4. Implement biometric authentication option

### 6.2 Network Security

**Current Implementation:**
- HTTPS API calls ✅
- JSON payload ✅
- No authentication tokens (local only) ✅

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable for current architecture

---

## 7. CREDITS & MONETIZATION

### 7.1 Current Implementation

**Credit System:**
- Guest users: 50 free credits
- New accounts: 10 credits
- No in-app purchases configured ⚠️

**Issue:** App mentions "Purchase Credits" but no IAP implemented
- **Location:** app/plans.tsx exists
- **Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL if enabled, P3 if disabled

**Options:**
1. **Remove credit purchase feature entirely** (simplest for v1.0)
2. **Implement proper Apple In-App Purchases:**
   - Configure in App Store Connect
   - Implement StoreKit integration
   - Add purchase restoration
   - Handle subscription management
   - Update privacy policy

**Recommendation:** Remove credit purchase UI for initial release, launch with free credits only. Add IAP in v1.1 after App Store approval.
